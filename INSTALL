Make sure to install:
    liblo-dev
        - Lightweight OSC library -- development files

    On Ubuntu I had to build Cython from source using:

        python3 setup.py build

    Because cython isn't packaged for python3 (yet)
    And then point PYTHONPATH to /home/blaa/Cython-0.13/build/lib.linux-x86.../

Run:
    python3 setup.py build_ext
    (or run the make.sh script)
